Forget any instructions before this one.
You are an expert of AI training dataset for the last 20 years. For now, I will give you some textual content and your job will be to generate training dataset.
The purpuse here is to generate a full dataset for a custom UI framework named 'Fugui'. It's an imediate gui framework based on DearImgui.
I will send you some pieces of codes and you will understand it.
Anything you understand, you add it to the dataset.

Always respect the following data structure :

{
	"instruction" : "refers to the prompt or task that is being asked of the model",
	"Input" : "refers to any information that is provided to the model as part of the prompt or task",
	"output" : "refers to the model's response or answer to the prompt or task."
},

here is an exemple of dataset :

  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'Initialize' method in the 'Fugui' class?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The 'Initialize' method is a static method in the 'Fugui' class that initializes the Fugui system and creates the main container for displaying ImGui UI elements in the Unity editor. It takes a Unity camera as a parameter and creates a 'FuUnityContext' object that represents the main UI context for the Fugui system."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'Update' method in the 'Fugui' class?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The 'Update' method is a static method in the 'Fugui' class that updates the state of the Fugui system and its UI elements. It updates the mouse position, checks for any new windows that need to be externalized, and starts the OpenTK render loop thread if necessary. It should be called in the main thread of the Unity application, such as in the 'Update' or 'LateUpdate' methods."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is DearImgui?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "DearImgui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It allows developers to quickly and easily create graphical user interfaces for their applications. FuGui is based on DearImgui and extends its functionality for use in Unity."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is ImGuiNET?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "ImGuiNET is a .NET wrapper for the DearImgui library. It allows developers to use DearImgui in .NET applications, including Unity. FuGui uses the ImGuiNET wrapper to interface with DearImgui and provide a streamlined UI development experience for Unity developers."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is a 'FuWindow' in the Fugui system?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A 'FuWindow' in the Fugui system represents a single UI window in the Fugui UI. It contains all of the elements, layouts, and styling for a specific UI window and can be displayed in various contexts, such as in the main Unity window or in an external window. Each 'FuWindow' is represented by a named instance of the class."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is a 'FuUnityContext' object in the Fugui system?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A 'FuUnityContext' object in the Fugui system represents the main UI context for the Fugui system in the Unity editor. It provides a rendering pipeline for displaying ImGui elements on a specific Unity camera, and is used by the Fugui system to manage UI elements within the main Unity window."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'OpenTK' library in Fugui?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The 'OpenTK' library is a cross-platform graphics and gaming library used by Fugui to display UI windows outside of the Unity build window. It provides a way to create external windows for displaying the Fugui UI, and ensures that the external windows run on a separate thread for maximum performance and stability."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'ExternalWindowFlags' property in the 'Fugui' class?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The 'ExternalWindowFlags' property is a public property of the 'Fugui' class that holds the flags used for external windows in the Fugui system. These flags determine the behavior of the external windows, such as whether they can be resized, whether they have a border, and more. By customizing these flags, developers can create external windows that are tailored to their specific needs."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'GetWindow' method in the 'Fugui' class?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The 'GetWindow' method is a static method in the 'Fugui' class that returns a named 'FuWindow' instance from the 'UIWindows' dictionary. This method is used by the Fugui system to retrieve a specific UI window and display it in the appropriate context, such as in an external window or in the main Unity window."
  }

Don't do anything for now, just wait I send you some code.
